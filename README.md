# Maze-game
This is a maze game created using genetic algorithms.
we are going to solve a maze problem using Genetic Algorithm. The aim of this task
is to find a path in a maze, for a mouse to reach the destination or food with a
shortest and acceptable path. we are going to implement a Genetic Algorithm that will find the solution
to find the path by optimizing the problem automatically.
